# Spanning Tree Protocol
## Spanning Tree Protocol Fundamentals
enables switches to become aware of other
switches through the advertisement and receipt of bridge protocol data units (BPDUs).

### 802.1D Port States
In the 802.1D STP protocol, every port transitions through the following states:
* **Disabled**: The port is in an administratively off position (that is, shut down).
* **Blocking**: The switch port is enabled, but the port is not forwarding any traffic
to ensure that a loop is not created. The switch does not modify the MAC address
table. It can only receive BPDUs from other switches.
* **Listening**: The switch port has transitioned from a blocking state and can now
send or receive BPDUs. It cannot forward any other network traffic. The duration
of the state correlates to the STP forwarding time. The next port state is learning.
* **Learning**: The switch port can now modify the MAC address table with any
network traffic that it receives. The switch still does not forward any other
network traffic besides BPDUs. The duration of the state correlates to the STP
forwarding time. The next port state is forwarding.
* **Forwarding**: The switch port can forward all network traffic and can update
the MAC address table as expected. This is the final state for a switch port to
forward network traffic.
* **Broken**: The switch has detected a configuration or an operational problem on a port that can have major effects. The port discards packets as long as the problem continues to exist.

### 802.1D Port Types

* **Root port (RP)**: A network port that connects to the root bridge or an upstream
switch in the spanning-tree topology. There should be only one root port per
VLAN on a switch.
* **Designated port (DP)**: A network port that receives and forwards BPDU
frames to other switches. Designated ports provide connectivity to downstreamdevices and switches. There should be only one active designated port on a link.
* **Blocking port**: A network that is not forwarding traffic because of STP
calculations.

### STP Key Terminology
Several key terms are related to STP:
* **Root bridge**: The root bridge is the most important switch in the Layer 2
topology. All ports are in a forwarding state. This switch is considered the top of
the spanning tree for all path calculations by other switches. All ports on the root
bridge are categorized as designated ports.
* **Bridge protocol data unit (BPDU)**: This network packet is used for network
switches to identify a hierarchy and notify of changes in the topology. A BPDU
uses the destination MAC address 01:80:c2:00:00:00. There are two types of
BPDUs:
* **Configuration BPDU**: This type of BPDU is used to identify the root bridge,
root ports, designated ports, and blocking ports. The configuration BPDU consists of the following fields: STP type, root path cost, root bridge identifier,
local bridge identifier, max age, hello time, and forward delay.
* **Topology change notification (TCN) BPDU**: This type of BPDU is used to
communicate changes in the Layer 2 topology to other switches. This is
explained in greater detail later in the chapter.
* **Root path cost**: This is the combined cost for a specific path toward the root
switch.
* **System priority**: This 4-bit value indicates the preference for a switch to be
root bridge. The default value is 32,768.
* **System ID extension**: This 12-bit value indicates the VLAN that the BPDU
correlates to. The system priority and system ID extension are combined as part
of the switch’s identification of the root bridge.
* **Root bridge identifier**: This is a combination of the root bridge system MAC
address, system ID extension, and system priority of the root bridge.
* **Local bridge identifier**: This is a combination of the local switch’s bridge
system MAC address, system ID extension, and system priority of the root
bridge.
* **Max age**: This is the maximum length of time that passes before a bridge port
saves its BPDU information. The default value is 20 seconds, but the value canbe configured with the command spanning-tree vlan vlan-id max-age maxage.
* **Hello time**: This is the time that a BPDU is advertised out of a port. The default
value is 2 seconds, but the value can be configured to 1 to 10 seconds with the
command spanning-tree vlan vlan-id hello-time hello-time.
* **Forward delay**: This is the amount of time that a port stays in a listening and learning state. The default value is 15 seconds, but the value can be changed to a
value of 15 to 30 seconds with the command ```spanning-tree vlan vlan-id forward-time``` forward-time.

### Spanning Tree Path Cost

Default Interface STP Port Costs

| Link Speed 	| Short-Mode STP Cost 	| Long-Mode STP Cost 	|
|------------	|---------------------	|--------------------	|
| 10 Mbps    	| 100                 	| 2,000,000          	|
| 1000 Mbps  	| 19                  	| 200,000            	|
| 1 Gbps     	| 4                   	| 20,000             	|
| 10 Gbps    	| 2                   	| 2,000              	|
| 20 Gbps    	| 1                   	| 1,000              	|
| 100 Gbps   	| 1                   	| 200                	|
| 1 Tbps     	| 1                   	| 20                 	|
| 10 Tbps    	| 1                   	| 2                  	|

### Root Bridge Election

Lower bridge ID in BPDU is more preferable

1. Current switch assumes it is the root bridge. Uses local bridge identifier as the root bridge identifier. Listens to neighbors configuration BPDUs

* If neighbor BPDU is inferier, current switch ignores BPDU.
* If neighbors BPDU is prefered, current switch updates its BPDUs to include new root bridge id with root path cost that correlates to the total path cost to reach the new root bridge. 

```
show spanning-tree root
```

### Locating Root Ports

1. Interface with lowest path cost

2. Interface associated with lowest system priority of the advertising switch is preferred next.

3. Interface with lowest system MAC address of advertising switch

4. When links associated to the same switch, lowest port priority from advertising switch is preferred.

5. When multiple links are associated to the same switch, the lower port number
from the advertising router is preferred.

### Locating Blocked Designated Switch Ports

Now that the root bridge and RPs have been identified, all other ports are
considered designated ports. However, if two non-root switches are connected to
each other on their designated ports, one of those switch ports must be set to a
blocking state to prevent a forwarding loop

1. Interface cannot be RP.
2. Switch with lower path cost to root bridge forwards packets, one with higher cost will block. 
3. Switch with the lowest system priority will have its port moved to blocking state.
4. Switch with lowest MAC address will have its port moved to blocking state.

``` 
show spanning-tree [vlan vlan id]
```

These port types are expected on Catalyst switches:
* **Point-to-point (P2P)**: This port type connects with another network device (PC
or RSTP switch).
* **P2P edge**: This port type specifies that portfast is enabled on this port.

### STP Topology Changes

* If a switch detects a topology change, a TCN is sent to root bridge.
* Root bridge receives packet and creates new configuration BPDU with Topology Change flag set flooded through all its switch ports. 
* When other switches receive flag set, all switches change MAC address timer to the forwarding delay timer (default 15 seconds). This will flush MAC addresses for devices that did not communicate within the 15 second timer. MAC address timer is then set back to its default 300 seconds. 

## Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol

RSTP seeked to improve STP with scalability, support load-balancing, and traffic engineering. 

### RSTP (802.1W) Port States

* **Discarding**: The switch port is enabled, but the port is not forwarding any
traffic to ensure that a loop is created. This state combines the traditional STP
states disabled, blocking, and listening.
* **Learning**: The switch port modifies the MAC address table with any network
traffic it receives. The switch still does not forward any other network traffic
besides BPDUs.
* **Forwarding**: The switch port forwards all network traffic and updates the
MAC address table as expected. This is the final state for a switch port to forward
network traffic.

### RSTP (802.1W) Port Roles

* **Root port (RP)**: A network port that connects to the root switch or an upstream
switch in the spanning-tree topology. There should be only one root port per
VLAN on a switch.
* **Designated port (DP)**: A network port that receives and forwards frames to
other switches. Designated ports provide connectivity to downstream devices and
switches. There should be only one active designated port on a link.
* **Alternate port**: A network port that provides alternate connectivity toward the
root switch through a different switch.
* **Backup port**: A network port that provides link redundancy toward the current
root switch. The backup port cannot guarantee connectivity to the root bridge in
the event that the upstream switch fails. A backup port exists only when multiple
links connect between the same switches.

### RSTP (802.1W) Port Types
RSTP defines three types of ports that are used for building the STP topology:
* **Edge port**: A port at the edge of the network where hosts connect to the Layer
2 topology with one interface and cannot form a loop. These ports directly
correlate to ports that have the STP portfast feature enabled.
* **Root port**: A port that has the best path cost toward the root bridge. There can
be only one root port on a switch.
* **Point-to-point port**: Any port that connects to another RSTP switch with full
duplex. Full-duplex links do not permit more than two devices on a network
segment, so determining whether a link is full duplex is the fastest way to check
the feasibility of being connected to a switch.

### Building the RSTP Topology

1. Two switches connect, verify they both are connected with point-to-point link by checking full-duplex status.

2. establish a handshake to advertise proposal with configuration BPDUs stating their interface should be the DP for that port.

3. Each switch identifies whether it is the superior or inferior switch using lowest priority > lowest MAC address. 

4. Inferior switch realizes its a loser and marks local port as RP. Moves all non edge ports to discarding state.

5. Loser switch sends agreement in configuration BPDU to root bridge telling him its syncing. 

6. Loser switch moves RP to forwarding and winning switch moves DP to forwarding.

7. Loser switch repeats the process for any downstream switches.
