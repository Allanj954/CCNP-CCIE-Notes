# EIGRP

### EIGRP Terminology

* **Successor route**: The route with the lowest path metric to reach a destination
* **Successor**: the first next-hop router for the successor route.
* **Feasible distance (FD)**: The metric value for the lowest-metric path to reach a destination.
* **Reported distance**: The distance reported by a router to reach a prefix. The reported distance value is the feasible distance for the advertising router.
* **Feasibility condition**: For a route to be considered a backup route, the reported distanced received for that route must be less than the feasible distance calculated locally.
* **Feasible Successor**: A route that satisfies the feasibility condition and is maintained as a backup route.

### Topology Table

EIGRP contains topology table that contains the following information:
* Network prefix
* EIGRP neighbors that have advertised that prefix
* Metrics from each neighbor (for example, reported distance, hop count)
* Values used for calculating the metric (for example, load, reliability, total delay,
minimum bandwidth)

### EIGRP Neighbors

EIGRP neighbors exchange the entire routing table when forming an adjacency,
and they advertise only incremental updates as topology changes occur within a
network

| 1    	| Hello       	| Used for discovery of EIGRP neighbors and for detecting when a neighbor is no longer available 	|
| 2    	| Request     	| Used to get specific information from one or more neighbors                                    	|
| 3    	| Update      	| Used to transmit routing and reachability information with other EIGRP neighbors               	|
| 4    	| Query       	| Sent out to search for another path during convergence                                         	|
| 5    	| Reply       	| Sent in response to a query packet                                                             	|

### Load Balancing

EIGRP supports unequal-cost load balancing, which allows installation of both
successor routes and feasible successors into the EIGRP RIB.

To do this, you must change the variable multiplier.

variance multiplier: the feasible distance (FD) for a route multiplied by the EIGRP variance multiplier. 

Any feasible successorâ€™s FD with a metric below the
EIGRP variance value is installed into the RIB

## Failure Detection and Timers

hello timer every 5 seconds by default, 60 seconds on T1 or lower interfaces.

hold timer defaults to three times the interval, 15 seconds by default, 180 seconds for slow interfaces.
