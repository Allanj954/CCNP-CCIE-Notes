# BGP
## BGP Fundamentals

BGP is a path vector routing protocol, does not contain complete topology of network. Behaves like distance vector protocols, ensuring that path is loop free.

uses TCP port 179

Autonomous system (AS): a collection of routers under a single organization's control.

### Path Attributes

- Well-known mandatory
- Well-known discretionary
- Optional transitive
- Optional non-transitive

## Loop prevention

BGP attribute AS_PATH is a mandatory attribute that includes a complete list of all ASNs that the prefixed advertisement passes through. 

### Address Families

MP-BGP allows an extension the address family (AFI). An AFI correlates to specific network protocol (IPv4 or IPv6)

subsequent address-family identifier (SAFI) allows granularity of either unicast or multicast

Every address family maintains seperate databases and configurations for each protocol (address family + sub-address family)

### Inter-Router Communication

Does not use hello packets to discover neighbors.

Can form neighbor adjacencies across hops.

Internal BGP (iBGP): sessions established on a iBGP router in the same AS or in the same BGP confederation. AD 200

External BGP (eBGP): Sessions established on routers in different AS. AD 20

### BGP Messages

1. Open: Sets up and establishes BGP adjencency. Uses Hold timer
2. Update: Advertises, updates, or withdraw routes
3. Notification: Indicates an error condition to a BGP neighbor
4. Keepalive: Ensures that BGP neighbors are still alive
