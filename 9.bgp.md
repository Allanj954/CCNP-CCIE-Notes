# BGP

## BGP Fundamentals

BGP is a path vector routing protocol, does not contain complete topology of network. Behaves like distance vector protocols, ensuring that path is loop free.

uses TCP port 179

Autonomous system (AS): a collection of routers under a single organization's control.

### Path Attributes

- Well-known mandatory
- Well-known discretionary
- Optional transitive
- Optional non-transitive

## Loop prevention

BGP attribute AS_PATH is a mandatory attribute that includes a complete list of all ASNs that the prefixed advertisement passes through.

### Address Families

MP-BGP allows an extension the address family (AFI). An AFI correlates to specific network protocol (IPv4 or IPv6)

subsequent address-family identifier (SAFI) allows granularity of either unicast or multicast

Every address family maintains seperate databases and configurations for each protocol (address family + sub-address family)

### Inter-Router Communication

Does not use hello packets to discover neighbors.

Can form neighbor adjacencies across hops.

Internal BGP (iBGP): sessions established on a iBGP router in the same AS or in the same BGP confederation. AD 200

External BGP (eBGP): Sessions established on routers in different AS. AD 20

### BGP Messages

1. Open: Sets up and establishes BGP adjencency. Uses Hold timer
2. Update: Advertises, updates, or withdraw routes
3. Notification: Indicates an error condition to a BGP neighbor
4. Keepalive: Ensures that BGP neighbors are still alive

- OPEN: Used to establish BGP adjacency. Both sides negotiate session capabilities before BGP peering is established. Message contains BGP version, ASN of originating router, hold time, BGP identifier, and other optional parameters.

- Hold time: an attribute sets the hold timer (seconds) for each BGP neighbor. When received an UPDATE or KEEPALIVE, hold timer resets. When hold timer hits 0, BGP session is torned, routes are removed, and update route withdraw message is sent to other BGP neighbors for affected prefixes.

- BGP identifier: BGP router ID, 32-bit unique number used to identify BGP routers in the advertised prefixes.

- KEEPALIVE: messages exchanged every one-third of the hold timer.

- UPDATE: message advertises any feasible routes, withdraws previously advertised routes, or can do both. Includes the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) which contains the prefix and associated BGP PAs.

- Notifications: Notification is sent when error is detected with BGP session.

### BGP Neighbor States

BGP forms a TCP session with neighbor routers called peers.

Uses finite-state machine (FSM) to maintain table of all BGP peers and operational status

Statuses include:
* Idle 
* Connect
* Active
* OpenSent
* OpenConfirm
* Established

## Idle
Detects start event and inniates TCP connection to peer and listens for new connection from peer.

After error causes BGP back to Idle for second time, ConnectRetryTimer set to 60 seconds.

## Connect

BGP initiates TCP connection. If 3-way handshake is completed, established BGP session resets ConnectRetryTimer and sends Open message to neighbor. Then changes to OpenSent state.

If the ConnectRetryTimer depletes before this stage is complete, a new TCP
connection is attempted, ConnectRetryTimer is reset, and the state is moved to
Active. If any other input is received, the state is changed to Idle.

Higher IP manages connection.

## Active

BGP states new 3-way TCP handshake. If connection established, Open message sent, holder timer set to 4 minutes, state to OpenSent. If failed, moved back to Connect state.

## OpenSent

Open message sent from original router and waiting for an Open message from peer. Once original router receives Open message, the following are checked:

* BGP versions match
* Source IP from OPEN must match config in router
* BGP identifiers must be unique
* Security parameters must be set correctly

If no errors, hold time is set using the lower value of the two, KEEPALIVE is sent. Connection state moved to OpenConfirm. If error, NOTIFCATION is sent and state moved back to Idle.

If receives a disconnect message, BGP connection closes, ConnectRetryTimer reset, state set to Active.

## OpenConfirm

Waits for KEEPALIVE or NOTIFICATION. If received neighbor's KEEPALIVE, state moved to Established. If hold timer expires, a stop event occurs, or NOTIFICATION is received, state is then moved to Idle.

## Established

BGP is established, neighbors exchange routes using UPDATE. hold timer resets if UPDATE and KEEPALIVE messages are received. State moves back to Idle if hold timer expires.

## Receiving and Viewing Routes

1. Adj-RIB-In: Contains raw NLRIs
2. Loc-RIB: Contains all NLRIs that originated locally or received from other BGP peers. After validity and next-hop reach check, BGP best-path algo selects best NLRI for specific prefix. Used for presenting routes to IP routing table.
3. Adj-RIB-Out: Contains NLRIs after outbound route policies have been processed.

BGP Route Processing:

1. Store route in Adj-RIB-In in original state and apply inbound route policy based on neighbor route was received from.
2. Update Loc-RIB with latest entry, Adj-RIB-In is cleared to save memory.
3. Pass validity check to verify route is valid and next-hop is resolvable in global RIB. If route fails, route remains in Loc-RIB.
4. Identify best BGP and pass only the best path and its path attribute.
5. Install best-path route into global RIB. Process outbound route policy, store non-discarded routes in Adj-RIB-Out, advertise to BGP peers.

## Route Summarization

Summarizing prefixes conserves router resources and accelerates best-path
calculation by reducing the size of the table.

Static: Create static route Null0 for summary network prefix with a network statement.

Dynamic: Configure an aggregation network prefix. When viable component routes that match the aggregate network prefix enter the BGP table, then the aggregate prefix is created.
