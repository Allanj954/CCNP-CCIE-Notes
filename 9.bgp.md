# BGP

## BGP Fundamentals

BGP is a path vector routing protocol, does not contain complete topology of network. Behaves like distance vector protocols, ensuring that path is loop free.

uses TCP port 179

Autonomous system (AS): a collection of routers under a single organization's control.

### Path Attributes

- Well-known mandatory
- Well-known discretionary
- Optional transitive
- Optional non-transitive

## Loop prevention

BGP attribute AS_PATH is a mandatory attribute that includes a complete list of all ASNs that the prefixed advertisement passes through.

### Address Families

MP-BGP allows an extension the address family (AFI). An AFI correlates to specific network protocol (IPv4 or IPv6)

subsequent address-family identifier (SAFI) allows granularity of either unicast or multicast

Every address family maintains seperate databases and configurations for each protocol (address family + sub-address family)

### Inter-Router Communication

Does not use hello packets to discover neighbors.

Can form neighbor adjacencies across hops.

Internal BGP (iBGP): sessions established on a iBGP router in the same AS or in the same BGP confederation. AD 200

External BGP (eBGP): Sessions established on routers in different AS. AD 20

### BGP Messages

1. Open: Sets up and establishes BGP adjencency. Uses Hold timer
2. Update: Advertises, updates, or withdraw routes
3. Notification: Indicates an error condition to a BGP neighbor
4. Keepalive: Ensures that BGP neighbors are still alive

- OPEN: Used to establish BGP adjacency. Both sides negotiate session capabilities before BGP peering is established. Message contains BGP version, ASN of originating router, hold time, BGP identifier, and other optional parameters.

- Hold time: an attribute sets the hold timer (seconds) for each BGP neighbor. When received an UPDATE or KEEPALIVE, hold timer resets. When hold timer hits 0, BGP session is torned, routes are removed, and update route withdraw message is sent to other BGP neighbors for affected prefixes.

- BGP identifier: BGP router ID, 32-bit unique number used to identify BGP routers in the advertised prefixes.

- KEEPALIVE: messages exchanged every one-third of the hold timer.

- UPDATE: message advertises any feasible routes, withdraws previously advertised routes, or can do both. Includes the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) which contains the prefix and associated BGP PAs.

- Notifications: Notification is sent when error is detected with BGP session.

### BGP Neighbor States

BGP forms a TCP session with neighbor routers called peers.
