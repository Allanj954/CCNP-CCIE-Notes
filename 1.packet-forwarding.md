# Network Device Communication

## The OSI Model

* Layer 7 - **Application**: Interface for receiving and sending data.
* Layer 6 - **Presentation**: Formatting of data and encryption.
* Layer 5 - **Session**: Tracking of packets.
* Layer 4 - **Transport**: End-to-end communication between devices.
* Layer 3 - **Network**: Logical addressing and routing of packets.
* Layer 2 - **Data Link**: Hardware addressing.
* Layer 1 - **Physical**: Media ype and connector.

### VLANS (Virtual LANs)
Provide logical segmentation by creating multiple broadcast domains on the same network switch.

VLAN Packet Structure

* **Tag protocol identifier (TPID)**: 16-bit field set to 0x8100 to idenfity the packet as an 802.1Q packet.
* **Priority code point (PCP)**: this 3-bit field indicates a class of service (CoS) as part of layer 2 quality of service (QoS) between switches.
* **Drop Eligible Indicator (DEI)**: 1-bit indicates whether the packet can be dropped when there is bandwidth contention (bottleneck that occurs).
* **VLAN identifier (VID)**: 12-bit field specifies the VLAN associated with a network packet.
* **VLAN 0**: reserved for 802.1P traffic (IEEE specification for giving Layer 2 switches the ability to prioritize traffic as well as perform dynamic multicast filtering). Cannot be modified or deleted.
* **VLAN 1**: default VLAN and cannot be modified or deleted.
* **VLAN 2-1001**: Normal VLAN range. Can be added, deleted, or modded.
* **VLAN 1006-3967 and 4048-4093**:are in extended VLAN range and can be added, deleted, or modded.

### Access Ports

fundemental building blocks of a manged switch. An access port is assigned to only one VLAN. Carries traffic from the specified VLAN to the device connected to it or from the device to other devices on the same VLAN on that switch.

### Trunk Ports

Can carry multiple VLANS. Used typically when multiple VLANS need connectivity between a switch and another switch, router, or firewall and using only one port.

### Packet Routing

### Process Switching

Also referred to as software switching or slow path is a switching mechanism in which the general purpose CPU on a router is in charge of packet switching.
* Used when packets sourced or destined to the router (using control traffic or routing).
* Packets that are too complex for the hardware to handle (That is, IP packets with IP options)
* Packets that require extra information that is not currently known (for example, ARP)

### Cisco Express Forwarding
Is a Cisco proprietary switching mechanism developed to keep up with the demands of evolving network infrastructures. Default switching mechanism used by Cisco platforms that use specialized application-specific integrated circuits and network processing units (NPU) for high packet throughput (hardware-based routers)

### Ternary Content addressable memory (TCAM)
Allows for the matching and evalation of a packet on more than one field. Extention of the CAM architecture but enchanced to allow for upper-layer processing such as identifying the layer 2/3 source/destination address, protocol, QoS markings, and so on.

### Centralized Forwarding 
When a route processor (RP) engine is equipped with a forwarding engine s that it can make all the packet switching decisions, this is known as centralized forwarding architecture.

### Distributed Forwarding 
If the line cards are equipped ith forwarding engine so they can make packet decisions without intervention of the route processor.

### Software CEF
* **Forwarding Information Base**:
known as software forwarding information base, built directly from the routing table, contains the next-hop IP address for each destination in the network.

* **Adjacency Table**: contains the directly connected next hop IP addresses and their corresponding next-hop MAC addresses as well as the egress interface MAC address.

### Hardware CEF
Packet throughput is greatly increased because packet switching responsibilities are on the line cards.

### Stateful switchover
A redendancy feature that allows a cisco router with two RPs to sync router configuration and control plane state information.
