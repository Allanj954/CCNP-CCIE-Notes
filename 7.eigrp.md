# EIGRP

### EIGRP Terminology

* **Successor route**: The route with the lowest path metric to reach a destination
* **Successor**: the first next-hop router for the successor route.
* **Feasible distance (FD)**: The metric value for the lowest-metric path to reach a destination.
* **Reported distance**: The distance reported by a router to reach a prefix. The reported distance value is the feasible distance for the advertising router.
* **Feasibility condition**: For a route to be considered a backup route, the reported distanced received for that route must be less than the feasible distance calculated locally.
* **Feasible Successor**: A route that satisfies the feasibility condition and is maintained as a backup route.

### Topology Table

EIGRP contains topology table that contains the following information:
* Network prefix
* EIGRP neighbors that have advertised that prefix
* Metrics from each neighbor (for example, reported distance, hop count)
* Values used for calculating the metric (for example, load, reliability, total delay,
minimum bandwidth)

### EIGRP Neighbors

EIGRP neighbors exchange the entire routing table when forming an adjacency,
and they advertise only incremental updates as topology changes occur within a
network


| Type 	| Packet Name 	| Function                                                                                       	|
|------	|-------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1    	| Hello       	| Used for discovery of EIGRP neighbors and for detecting when a neighbor is no longer available 	|
| 2    	| Request     	| Used to get specific information from one or more neighbors                                    	|
| 3    	| Update      	| Used to transmit routing and reachability information with other EIGRP neighbors               	|
| 4    	| Query       	| Sent out to search for another path during convergence                                         	|
| 5    	| Reply       	| Sent in response to a query packet                                                             	|

### Load Balancing

EIGRP supports unequal-cost load balancing, which allows installation of both
successor routes and feasible successors into the EIGRP RIB.

To do this, you must change the variable multiplier.

variance multiplier: the feasible distance (FD) for a route multiplied by the EIGRP variance multiplier. 

Any feasible successorâ€™s FD with a metric below the
EIGRP variance value is installed into the RIB

## Failure Detection and Timers

hello timer every 5 seconds by default, 60 seconds on T1 or lower interfaces.

hold timer defaults to three times the interval, 15 seconds by default, 180 seconds for slow interfaces.

### Convergence

Convergence processor:

* Feasible sucessor instantly becomes the sucessor route, providing a backup route.
* Router sends out an update packet for that path due to new metrics.
* Downstream routers run their own DUAL for any impacted prefixes.

If Feasible successor is not available, run the following:

* Route state changes from Passive to Active
* The router detecting the topology change sends out query packets to EIGRP neighbors for the route. Packet includes network prefix and delay set to infinity. Set reply status flag set for each neighboy on a prefix basis (?).

Upon receipt of a query packet:

Either...
* router might reply to the query that router does not have the route.

or 

* If the query did not come from the successor for that route, it detects the delay
set for infinity but ignores it because it did not come from the successor. The
receiving router replies with the EIGRP attributes for that route.

or

* If the query came from the successor for the route, the receiving router detects
the delay set for infinity, sets the prefix as active in the EIGRP topology, and
sends out a query packet to all downstream EIGRP neighbors for that route.

### Route Summarization

EIGRP summarizes network prefixes on an interface basis. A summary aggregate
is configured for the EIGRP interface. Prefixes within the summary aggregate are
suppressed, and the summary aggregate prefix is advertised in lieu of the original
prefixes.
