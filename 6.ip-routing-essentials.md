# IP Routing Essentials

## Routing Protocol Overview

A router's main function is to move an IP packet from one network to another. Routers learn of routes from static configurations or dynamic IP routing protocols.

Commons Routing protocols

- Routing Information Protocol Version 2 (RIPv2) (IGP)
- Enhance Interior Gateway Routing (EIGRP) (IGP)
- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) (IGP)
- Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) (IGP)
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) (EGP)

### Distance Vector Algorithms

Distance vector routing protocols advertise routes as vectors, where distance is a metric such as hop count, and vector is the next-hop router's IP used to reach the destination:

- **Distance**: the route metric to reach a network
- **Vector**: The interface or direction to reach the network

A distance vector protocol advertises the routing information to their neighbors from their own perspective

"a distance vector protocol does not have a complete map of
the whole network; instead, its database reflects that a neighbor router knows
how to reach the destination network and how far the neighbor router is from the
destination network."

Requires less CPU and memory than other protocols

### Enhance Distance Vector Algorithms

An example of an enhanced distance vector algorithm is the DUAL algorthm that EIGRP uses.

EIGRP advertises network information to its neighbors like other distance routing protocols.
EIGRP also known as a hybrid routing protocol

- Offers rapid convergence
- Sends updates only when there are changes in the network. Does not send full routing table updates.
- Uses hellos and forms neighbor relationships
- Uses bandwidth, delay, reliability, load, and MTU size instead of hop count
- Can load balance traffic across equal or unequal links.

### Link-State Algorithms

Advertises the link state and link metric for each of its connected links and directly connected routers to every router in the network.

- OSPF
- IS-IS

OSPF Uses a complete map of the network and calculates using Dijkstra shortest path first (SPF) algorithm.

Requires more CPU and memory. Less prone to routing loops

### Path Vector Algorithm

Similar to distance but looks at various BGP path attributes to make routing decisions.

- BGP

Provides loop-free paths by keeping records of each autonomous system that the routing advertisement traverses.

"A router identifies the path a packet should take by evaluating the prefix length
that is programmed in the Forwarding Information Base (FIB). The FIB is
programmed through the routing table, which is also known as the Routing
Information Base (RIB)."

Path selection has three components:

- Prefix length: Number of leading binary bits in the submet mask that are in the on position
- Administrative distance: rating of trustworthiness of a routing source
- Metrics: A unit of measure used by a routing protocol in the best path calculation.

## Static Routing

Static routs provide good control over routing but may not scale well in growing networks.

### Static Route Types

- Directly attached static routes: directly connected
- Recursive static route: Connected via another network
- Fully specified static route: Connected via another network and specified interface port

### Static Null Interface

Interface is always in an up state but drops all traffic. Good for filtering unwanted traffic to reduce CP and possible prevent routing loops.

## Virtual Routing and Forwarding

VRF is a technology sued to create seperate virtual routers on a physical router. VRF maintains its own segmentation between network interfacesm subinterfacesm IP addressesm abd routing tables.
