# Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

## OSPF Fundamentals 

### Inter-Router Communication

OSPF uses protocol 89 reserved by the IANA. 

OSPF uses multicast to reduce unecessary traffic: 

* **AllSPFRouters**: IPv4 address **224.0.0.5** or MAC address **01:00:5E:00:00:05**.
All routers running OSPF should be able to receive these packets.
* **AllDRouters**: IPv4 address **224.0.0.6** or MAC address **01:00:5E:00:00:06**.
Communication with designated routers (DRs) uses this address.

### Designated Router and Backup Designated Router

The DR reduces the number of OSPF
adjacencies on a multi-access network segment because routers only form a full
OSPF adjacency with the DR and not each other.

The DR is responsible for
flooding updates to all OSPF routers on that segment as the updates occur.

The DR/BDR process distributes LSAs in the following sequence:

1. All OSPF routers form full OSPF adjacencies with DR and BDR

2. When OSPF router learns of new route, it sends updated LSA to the AllDRouters address (224.0.0.6), which only DR and BDR receive and process

3. The DR sends a unicast asknowledgement to the router that sent the initial LSA update

4. The DR floods LSA to all the routers on the segment via the AllSPFRouters address (224.0.0.5)

## OSPF Configuration

To initialize the OSPF process on a router:

```
router ospf process-id
```

OSPF is enabled on an interface using:

* An OSPF network statement
* Interface-specific configuration

### OSPF Network Statement

The selection of interfacs within the OSPF process is accomplished using:

**network** ip-address wildcard-mask **area** area-id
example: ``` network 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.255 area 0 ```

### Interface-Specific Configuration

The selection of interfacs within the OSPF process is accomplished using:

** ip ospf ** process-id **area** area-id **[secondaries none] **

### Statically Setting the Router ID

RId is dynamically allocated to highest IP of any UP loopback address. If no loopbacks, uses highest IP address of any active port. 

Static configuration: ** router-id ** router-id
Restart OSPF process: **ip ospf process**

### Passive Interfaces

Making the network
interface passive still adds the network segment into the LSDB but prohibits theinterface from forming OSPF adjacencies. A passive interface does not send out
OSPF hellos and does not process any received OSPF packets.

Configure passive interface under OSPF process: **passive** interface-id

Configure passive interface on all interfaces: **passive interface default**

Allow for interface to process OSPF packets: **no passive** interface-id

### Requirements for Neighbor Adjacency

The following list of requirements must be met for an OSPF neighborship to be
formed:

* RIDs must be unique between two devices
* Interfaces must share common subnet
* The MTUs on interfaces must match
* The area ID must match for the segment
* The DR enablement must match for the segment
* OSPF hello and dead timers must match
* Authentication type and credentials must match
* Area type flags must match

## Default Route Advertisement

OSPF supports advertising the default route into the OSPF domain.

Configuration: **default-information originate** [always][metric-type type-value]

![OSPF-Default-Route-Topology](/images/ospf-defaultroute-example.png)

OSPF will advertise R1 default route even though it is beyond the edge of the area.

## Common OSPF Optimizations

### Link Costs

Link Cost = Reference Bandwidth / Interface Bandwidth
