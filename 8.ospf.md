# Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

## OSPF Fundamentals 

### Inter-Router Communication

OSPF uses protocol 89 reserved by the IANA. 

OSPF uses multicast to reduce unecessary traffic: 

* **AllSPFRouters**: IPv4 address **224.0.0.5** or MAC address **01:00:5E:00:00:05**.
All routers running OSPF should be able to receive these packets.
* **AllDRouters**: IPv4 address **224.0.0.6** or MAC address **01:00:5E:00:00:06**.
Communication with designated routers (DRs) uses this address.

| Type 	| Packet Names                       	| Functional Overview                                                                                                                                                        	|
|------	|------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1    	| Hello                              	| Packets are used for discovering and maintaining neighbors. Packets are sent out over all OSPF interfaces to discover new neighbors while maintaining other neighbors.     	|
| 2    	| Database description (DBD or (DDP) 	| Packets are for summarizing database contents. Packets are exchanged when OSPF adjacency is first formed. Packets are used to describe the contents of the LSDB.           	|
| 3    	| Link-state request (LSR)           	| These packets are for the database downloads. When a router thinks part of its LSDB is stale, it may request a portion of a neighbor's database by using this packet type. 	|
| 4    	| Link-state update (LSU)            	| Packets used for database updates. This is an explicit LSA for a specific network link normally is sent in response to an LSR.                                             	|
| 5    	| Link-state ack                     	| Packets are for flooding acknowledgement. Sent in response to flooding of LSAs.                                                                                            	|

| Area ID                                        	| OSPF area that the OSPF interface belongs to.                                                                    	|

| Dead interval                                  	| time span that a router waits to hear a hellp from a neighbor router before declaring that the neighbor is down. 	|

### Designated Router and Backup Designated Router

The DR reduces the number of OSPF
adjacencies on a multi-access network segment because routers only form a full
OSPF adjacency with the DR and not each other

The DR is responsible for
flooding updates to all OSPF routers on that segment as the updates occur
